Data cleaning is the first step in the checklist before building any model. 

Data visualization is the second step. It is a graphical representation of the data, like graphs, charts, and maps. Data visualization helps us to understand outliers, patterns, and trends in the data.

Data Manipulation is the third step. It can be carried out with the Python package called pandas. Usually, the data that we get, or have collected, has gaps, missing values, incorrect date formats, missing variable names, or variables scattered into multiple columns. When this kind of data is presented for analysis, data manipulation techniques make it tidy.
