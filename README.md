Data cleaning is the first step in the checklist before building any model. 

Data visualization is the second step. It is a graphical representation of the data, like graphs, charts, and maps. Data visualization helps us to understand outliers, patterns, and trends in the data.

Data Manipulation is the third step. It can be carried out with the Python package called pandas. Usually, the data that we get, or have collected, has gaps, missing values, incorrect date formats, missing variable names, or variables scattered into multiple columns. When this kind of data is presented for analysis, data manipulation techniques make it tidy. 

Machine learning models try to use the underlying patterns and relationships in data to make new predictions. It helps to analyse data sets fast and improve demand forecasting accuracy

Machine learning intermediate involves handling missing values, non-numeric values, data leakage and more using various techniques like pipelines, XGBoost. By performing these operations, models will be more accurate and useful.

Machine learning explainability - permutation imortance, SHAP values - an acronym from SHapley Additive exPlanations break down a prediction to show the impact of each feature. SHAP values interpret the impact of having a certain value for a given feature in comparison to the prediction we'd make if that feature took some baseline value.

For a feature to be useful, it must have a relationship to the target that your model is able to learn. The output from feature engineering is fed to the predictive models, and the results are cross-validated.
